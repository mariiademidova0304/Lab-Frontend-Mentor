# Reflection
1. Using Figma made it much easier as I didn't have to think about design. The project had visual representation, which also helped me figure out faster the containers needed and the overall structure.
2. The challenge I've encountered was aligning items in the containers: I would try aligning items in one, but then figure out I was supposed to be aligning another. Also the fonts were similar and I spent quite a big amount of time mixing them up. I'm not sure whether we were supposed to use the :focus element because I've tried adding it instead of :hover and I didn't work out. I guess I need to read more on the types of elements you could add those states to.
3. I haven't tried feedback and community resources to be honest, but I've found the challenges to be very interesting and wish I have more time to continue with them. As well as check community examples.
